# Frontend Mentor - Manage landing page solution

## Overview

### The challenge

This is my version of Fronend Mentor - Manage Landing Page solution
I started out by folowing a tutorial using Tailwind CSS to create the landing page.

After that I did a second version, using plain HTML, CSS and a some Javascript. This is the version that I include in this repo.

While writing the HTML, CSS I used the BEM methology for CSS design
For the testimonial slider, I used SwiperJS
